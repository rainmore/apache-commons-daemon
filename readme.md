It is a simple example to demonstrate how apache common daemon works.

All those code was originally from Creating a Java Daemon (System Service) for Debian using Apache Commons Jsvc http://www.neilson.co.za/?p=253

To run it, you need to make sure jsvc is installed on your LINUX machine.

To install jsvc on ubuntu, run  "sudo apt-get install jsvc"
